You are in the first room of the dungeon. Be careful!XThere is nothing in here but dust and darkness.XThe lifeless husk of a creature lies on the floor.XYou found some treasure in here, that was pretty sweet.XYou encountered a Mystic in this room, how spooky.XThis room has the stairs to the next level of the dungeon, oh boy.
